Hey Guys!,

My name is Bhuvanesh Chandrashekhar Korlahalli in my third semester of Master's in Data Analytics at San Jose State University. This repo is maintained as a playground for the concepts I have learnt during my coursework. I will uploading all the assignments and projects I have done along with the learnings and shortcomings I faced during this process. Hope to create an engaging platform here.

Toodles,
Bhuvanesh Chandrashekhar Korlahalli.

PS: I usually do not have such boring and emoji-less texts, still figuring that out here :P.
